# ⚡ Velto – Smarter Autocompletion for TypeScript & JavaScript

**Velto** is your new coding sidekick for VS Code—designed to make autocompletion in TypeScript and JavaScript smarter, faster, and more intuitive.

Starting with intelligent `export` snippets, Velto is just getting warmed up. The goal? Build a growing suite of enhancements that cut down boilerplate, reduce friction, and help you stay in flow while coding.

## ✨ What Velto Does Today

- 🚀 **Smart Export Suggestions**  
  Instantly get completions for `export` statements as soon as you type `exp`, `expo`, etc.

- 🧠 **Context-Aware Snippets**  
  Snippets auto-fill with your current file name (without the extension) as a default, so you can skip the repetitive stuff.

- ⌨️ **Fast, Flexible Symbol Insertion**  
  Snippets include tab stops so you can quickly rename identifiers as needed.

- ⚙️ **Works Seamlessly With**:
  - JavaScript (`.js`)
  - TypeScript (`.ts`)
  - React (JSX / TSX)
